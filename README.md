# EDGE_lineages_ZSL

This is Christopher Low's github page for his second MRes Biodiversity, Evolution and Conservation project 2 titled:

EDGE of extinction: Determining mammalian conservation trends to identify the worldâ€™s most evolutionary distinct lineages.

All R scripts were uploaded from R to github through a repository and are labelled in accordance to each section of the project.

Enjoy :)
